# 278. First Bad Version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example:**
```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for isBadVersion()
 * 
 * @param {integer} version number
 * @return {boolean} whether the version is bad
 * isBadVersion = function(version) {
 *     ...
 * };
 */

/**
 * @param {function} isBadVersion()
 * @return {function}
 */
var solution = function(isBadVersion) {
  /**
   * @param {integer} n Total versions
   * @return {integer} The first bad version
   */
  return function(n) {
    if (n === 1) return isBadVersion(1)
    let left = 0
    let right = n
    while (left <= right) {
      const mid = Math.floor((right + left) / 2)
      if (isBadVersion(mid) && !isBadVersion(mid - 1)) {
        return mid
      } else if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
        right = mid - 1
      } else {
        left = mid + 1
      }
    }
  };
};
```
