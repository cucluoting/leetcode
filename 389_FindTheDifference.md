# 389. Find the Difference

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

**Example:**
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {character}
 */
var findTheDifference = function(s, t) {
  let result = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    result ^= s.charCodeAt(i);
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
    result ^= t.charCodeAt(i);
  }
  return String.fromCharCode(result);
};
```
